This system will benefit customers, employees, and administrators by enabling customers to manage their accounts (F1), perform online transactions (F3), and update personal information (F1); empowering employees to handle transactions (F4); and allowing administrators to oversee banking operations (F5).  The key business value delivered includes streamlined transaction processing (F3, F4), enhanced customer account management capabilities (F1), integration with external financial service providers (F6), robust security measures to protect sensitive data (NF5, NF6), and improved operational efficiency through automated processes such as loan application approvals (F14) and reporting and analytics tools (F9).  The system will also maintain accurate customer records (F2), apply a fixed fee for overdrafts (F12), and calculate savings account interest based on a fixed annual rate (F13).",

banking system, based on the provided requirements document.\n\u2022 *1. Authentication Mechanisms:**\n\u2022 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  All user accounts, including customer and employee accounts, must utilize MFA.  The specific MFA methods (e.g., SMS, email, authenticator app) are to be determined based on risk assessment and regulatory compliance.  (Requirement F7)\n\u2022 **Strong Passwords:**  Users must adhere to a strong password policy, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and password history restrictions.  (Implied by F7, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 **Session Management:**  The system shall implement robust session management, including timeouts, automatic logouts, and secure session tokens.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 **Account Lockout:**  The system shall implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 *2. Authorization Controls:**\n\u2022 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  The system shall employ RBAC to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities based on user roles (e.g., customer, teller, administrator).  (Requirement F7)\n\u2022 **Granular Permissions:**  Permissions within each role must be granular, allowing access only to the necessary functionalities and data.  (Implied by F7, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  ACLs shall be implemented to control access to specific data records and resources.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 *3. Data Protection Measures:**\n\u2022 **Data Encryption:**  All sensitive data (e.g., account balances, transaction details, customer information) shall be encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption.  (Requirement NF5)\n\u2022 **Data Masking/Anonymization:**  Data masking or anonymization techniques shall be employed for non-sensitive data during testing and development to protect sensitive information.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  DLP mechanisms shall be implemented to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 *4. Audit Requirements:**\n\u2022 **Transaction Logging:**  The system shall maintain comprehensive transaction logs for all financial transactions, including details of the user, date, time, and amount.  (Requirement F8)\n\u2022 **User Activity Logging:**  Detailed logs of all user activities (e.g., login attempts, data access, system configuration changes) shall be maintained.  (Requirement F8)\n\u2022 **Audit Trails:**  Audit trails shall be generated for all critical system changes and actions.  (Requirement F8)\n\u2022 **Regular Auditing:**  Regular security audits shall be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 *5. Compliance Standards:**\n\u2022 **PCI DSS:**  The system shall comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements.  (Implied by the mention of security measures in the gaps section.)\n\u2022 **GDPR:**  The system shall comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.  (Implied by the mention of security measures in the gaps section.)\n\u2022 **KYC/AML:**  The system shall comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.  (Requirement F8)\n\u2022 **SOX:**  The system shall comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requirements.  (Implied by the mention of security measures in the gaps section.)\n\u2022 **Other Relevant Regulations:**  The system shall comply with all other relevant banking regulations and industry best practices.  (Implied, but not explicitly stated.  Should be a separate requirement.)\n\u2022 *Traceability:**  All security requirements are traceable to the explicit and gap analysis requirements, as noted in parentheses.  Further detailed requirements for specific security measures (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, incident response plans) are not explicitly stated and should be added as separate requirements.\n\u2022 *Note:** This document provides a high-level overview of security requirements.  Detailed specifications for each requirement, including specific implementation details, are necessary for a complete security design.",

within the provided banking system requirements document.\n\u2022 *1. Technical Constraints**\n\u2022 **Transaction Processing Speed:** The system must process online banking transactions in under 1 second (Requirement NF1).  This implies limitations on database query times, network latency, and server processing power.\n\u2022 **Concurrent User Capacity:** The system must support 10,000 concurrent users (Requirement NF2). This necessitates sufficient server capacity, load balancing mechanisms, and database scalability to handle peak usage periods.\n\u2022 **System Uptime:** The system must maintain 99.9% uptime (Requirement NF3). This mandates robust disaster recovery planning, including backup and failover mechanisms, and continuous monitoring of system health.\n\u2022 **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**  System recovery time after failure must be less than 1 hour (Requirement NF4). This necessitates a well-defined disaster recovery plan with clear procedures for data restoration and system restart.\n\u2022 **Data Encryption:** Sensitive customer data must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption (Requirement NF5).  This implies limitations on the types of encryption algorithms and key management systems that can be used.\n\u2022 **Security Measures Implementation:**  Specific security measures (e.g., data encryption, fraud detection, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing) are required (Requirement NF6).  The document does not specify the level of detail or specific technologies to be used. This leaves room for implementation choices but requires a detailed security plan.\n\u2022 **Performance and Scalability Requirements:** The system must meet specific performance and scalability requirements (Requirement NF7).  The document does not specify these requirements, leaving them to be defined based on the chosen approach.\n\u2022 *2. Business Constraints**\n\u2022 **Overdraft Fee Structure:** Overdraft fees are fixed per occurrence, regardless of the amount (Requirement F12). This limits the system's ability to adjust fees based on specific circumstances.\n\u2022 **Savings Account Interest Rates:** Savings account interest rates are fixed annually (Requirement F13). This limits the system's ability to adjust interest rates dynamically based on market conditions.\n\u2022 **Loan Application Approval:** Loan application approvals are automated based on credit score and pre-defined criteria (Requirement F14). This limits the system's ability to handle exceptions or complex loan scenarios requiring manual intervention.\n\u2022 *3. Regulatory Requirements**\n\u2022 **KYC/AML Compliance:** The system must integrate KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks (Requirement F8). This implies compliance with specific regulations and limitations on data handling and reporting.\n\u2022 **GDPR, SOX, and other relevant regulations:** The system must comply with relevant regulations, including GDPR and SOX (Requirement F8).  Specific details on these regulations are not provided.\n\u2022 **Data Retention Policies:** Data retention policies must be implemented (Requirement F8).  The document does not specify the duration or types of data to be retained.\n\u2022 *4. Integration Limitations**\n\u2022 **Financial Service Provider Integration:** The system must integrate with financial service providers (Requirement F6). The specific providers and the level of integration are not detailed, creating limitations on the types of transactions and data exchange supported.\n\u2022 *5. Implementation Restrictions**\n\u2022 **No Innovative Features Defined:** The document does not specify any innovative features, limiting the scope of development to the explicitly stated requirements.\n\u2022 **No Scope Analysis:** The document lacks a scope analysis, which would provide further details on the boundaries of the system.\n\u2022 *Traceability to Requirements:**\n\u2022 All constraints and limitations are directly traceable to the functional and non-functional requirements (F# and NF#) listed in the provided document.  The lack of specific details in some requirements (e.g., NF7) creates further constraints that need to be addressed in subsequent design and implementation phases.",

focusing on aspects not fully addressed in the provided banking system requirements document.\n\u2022 *1. Special Cases:**\n\u2022 **Fraudulent Activity Detection:**  While fraud detection is mentioned as a security measure (NF6), specific algorithms and thresholds for detecting various types of fraud (e.g., account takeover, phishing, money laundering) need to be defined.  This includes defining false positive rates and acceptable response times for alerts.\n\u2022 **International Transactions:**  The document lacks details on handling international transactions.  This includes currency conversion, exchange rate management, compliance with international regulations (e.g., SWIFT), and potential transaction delays.\n\u2022 **Customer Support:**  The document does not explicitly address customer support channels.
